# Gemini Clone

Gemini Clone is a web application built using React.js, Firebase, and Google Sign-In for authentication.

## Features

- **React.js:** Utilizes React.js for building user interfaces and managing state.
- **Firebase:** Integrates Firebase for backend services such as authentication, database management, and storing user search data.
- **Google Sign-In:** Implements Google Sign-In for easy and secure authentication.
- **Gemini Clone:** A replica of Gemini designed to provide a similar user experience and functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Google Firebase account
- React.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  [ git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-clone.git](https://github.com/kamlesh-Sahani/Gemini_clone_Full_Stack.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gemini-clone
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.
   - Add a web app to your Firebase project.
   - Copy your Firebase configuration settings (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) from the Firebase console.
   - Paste your Firebase configuration in the `src/firebase/config.js` file.

5. Set up Firestore Database:
   - In the Firebase console, navigate to Firestore Database.
   - Create a new collection named "searches" to store user search data.
   - Define the structure of the documents in the "searches" collection based on your application's needs (e.g., user ID, search query, timestamp).

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Usage

- Sign up for an account using Google Sign-In.
- Explore the Gemini Clone interface.
